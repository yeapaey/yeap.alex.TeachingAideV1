Lesson needs to be made comparable.
Something wrong with the while loop in DataEngine:38 (getTeachable) - DONE



**********************************

* Consider making things like id prefixes an enum
* Abstract ID may no longer be needed 



Alternate design:

* Create students, then have "Individual Class" and "Group Class". 
	* For a student to receive (new) lessons they must belong to one of these classes.
	* The student holds the master copy of all its lessons
	* Does the class hold a reference to it's lessons? Probably yes, both the student(s) and 
	  the group link to the same lesson object.
	* Group Class is either and extension of Indivdual Class or IC is a limited version of GC.  
		* IC subclasses Group and overwrites addStudent() to only allow one student in the list at a time.
		* either this or just have an attribute but getStudents() wraps it in a collection  

	
Individual:
* Name
* Student
* Lessons<>
* ID


Group:
* Name
* Students<>
* Lessons<>
* ID
